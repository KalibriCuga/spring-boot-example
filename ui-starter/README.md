ui-starter
=========
Starter project for the UI in react

## Installing the code after git clone
Execute in a terminal from within the `ui-starter` directory:
*Note*: This step may take minutes while it downloads all the npm dependencies

    npm install

## Local development server for the UI
Local watch-rebuild on file changes
In a terminal at the `ui-starter` directory, this will have webpack rebuild on any changes immediately visible on a local machine without needing to re-run. E.g.:

     npm run ui

## Accessing the UI
With the above ^ service running, use a browser to access:

    http://localhost:9000
